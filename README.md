# CodeEvaluationDocs

In this repository, step by step instructions on how to prepare your code and its dependecy/requiremnts are given in two separate folders of: 

+ CodeEvaluationInstructions
+ SingularityTutorial

First you need to follow the given instructions at CodeEvaluationInstructions/README.md. Then prepare a container for your code following SingularityTutorial/README.md.

##CodeEvaluationInstructions

In this folder, an instruction guide (README.md) on how to prepare the input and output of your algorithm along with their associated folders to run your code
for convenient independent evaluation on both the contest data and on the full trial dataset are embeded. 

##SingularityTutorial

In this folder, a tutorial on how to make your code reproducible using Singularity container alnog with a running example is given.
